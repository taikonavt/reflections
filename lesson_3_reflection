When would you wnat to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you have several working machine it is would be easy for you to keep you file in the Internet, so you can get access to files from every PC.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I could want not to show code to somebody else.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you appeared in forest accidantly you would be able to continue your work.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without git you can collaborate with telefon, email, etc. It would be faster to make a change, but harder to trak changes.
